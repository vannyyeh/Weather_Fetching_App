# Weather_Fetching_App

This is a weather-fetching data application. It pulls the data from the “open weather map” and gives users the most real-time weather information based on your input location, and it can also provide you with historical data of Texas state. Therefore, this program breaks into two parts. One is the current data, and the other one is the historical data. Users can easily switch between two functions by going back to the homepage. The `help` function has been implemented and guides the user when they lose in the game.
